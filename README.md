# Instructions
Your mission is simple. Race between the Sothern and Northern sets of marker buoys before the clock runs. The Nothern set isn't always in the same place! You must go through both gates. Green on the left, red on the right. And don't jump the starting gun! You WILL be disqualified.

Press 'S' to Start.
